# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of AWS https client library with ethernet driver on Renesas RA MCUs 
based on Renesas FSP using FreeRTOS. aws client is used to connect to https adafruit server which is cloud platform. 
On successful connection, menu is displayed enabling user to send GET,PUT,POST requests to adafruit server. On POST/PUT 
request, MCU Die temperature is read via(using) ADC and uploaded to server. On GET request, the last MCU die temperature 
data is read from the adafruit server. JlinkRTTViewer is used to display the status and responses of the requests made to server.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Special Topics ##

**1. Obtaining Adafruit server credentials**:

Following steps guide you how to obtain the username and AIO key.

1.Go to https://io.adafruit.com. Click on **Get Started for Free** option as shown in the  below image

![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_getstart.jpg "adafruit getting started")

2. Create an account by providing the requested details to obtain user credintails viz., **username** and **password** 
3. After successful creation of account, user name will display on top of the page as shown in below image. Click on **IO**, dashboard will displays with the following options **Feeds , Dashboards, My key** etc.


 ![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_dashboard.jpg "adafruit dashboard")
 
 4.  Click on My Key option to see your username and Active key. These two details are important for communicating with adafruit server. If the key is compromised, we can generate the new key by clicking on the Regenerate key option as shown in below image.

 ![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_io_key.jpg "adafruit io key") 
 
 5. After obtaining the user name and io key. User has to update the following details at respective url macros in the aws_https_client_ep/src/user_app.h file as shown in the below image.

![aws_https_cleint](images/user_config_macro.jpg "user configuration macros")




**2. Obtaining Server Certificate:**

1. Open browser and copy paste the following url http://cacerts.geotrust.com/GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt. Server certificate with .crt extension will be downloaded with the file name **GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt**

2. After downloaded the .crt file, need to be convert to .pem format using OpenSSL.

3. OpenSSL can be downloaded from  https://www.openssl.org/source/. depends on the Operating System, required installer can be downloaded and installed.

4. Copy the downloaded certificate to the bin folder of your installed openssl.

5. Open the cmd prompt in Administrator mode from the bin folder as shown in the below image.

 ![aws_https_client](images/openssl_win.jpg "OpenSSL window")

 6. Type the conversion command :**Openssl.exe x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt -out GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt.pem** as shown below image
 
 ![aws_https_client](images/openssl_conversion_cmd.jpg "OpenSSL conversion command")
 
 7. GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt.pem file will be generated in your bin folder as shown in below image.
 
![aws_https_client](images/openssl_bin.jpg "openssl bin folder")

8. Open the converted certificate file with notepad and copy the content and update in the aws_https_client_ep\src\usr_app.h file at the **HTTPS_TRUSTED_ROOT_CA** macro as shown in below image.

![aws_https_client](images/server_certificate.jpg "server certificate macro updation")




**3. Obtaining Client Certificate and Private Key:**

1. Open the cmd prompt from the bin folder of installed Openssl. 
![aws_https_client](images/openssl_win.jpg "OpenSSL window")

2. To generate the private key and CSR certificate use the command **openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout clientside.key -x509 -days 365 -out clientside.crt**  as shown below.
**NOTE:** Output file can be any name.

![aws_https_client](images/open_ssl_client_key.jpg "OpenSSL Client Key")

3. clientside.key and clientside.crt files are generated in binary folder. Verify client certificate is properly generated by using command **openssl x509 -text -noout -in clientside.crt** as shown below.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_Certificate_validation.jpg "OpenSSL Client Key validation")

4. Generated client certificate is in .crt format. It has to be converted to .pem format. Conversion can be done from .crt to .der and then .der to .pem. 
To convert from .crt to .der, Use the command **openssl x509 -in clientside.crt -outform der -out clientside.der** as shown below.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_crt_der_conversion.jpg "OpenSSL format conversion")

5. To convert .der to .pem use the command **openssl x509 -in clientside.crt -outform der -out clientside.der** as shown below.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_der_pem_conversion.jpg "OpenSSL format conversion")

6. The generated files can be found in bin folder of OpenSSL installed software as shown in below image.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_Generated_files.jpg "OpenSSL Generated files")

7. Open the generated files in notepad and copy the content and paste in the aws_https_client_ep/src/usr_app.h 

 i . Copied client certificate to be update at the CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM macro as shown in below image.
 
 ![aws_https_client](images/update_client_certificate.jpg "Update client certificate pem")
 
 ii. Copied client key to be update at the CLIENT_KEY_PEM macro as shown in below image.
 
  ![aws_https_client](images/update_client_key.jpg "Update client key pem")
  
  
**NOTE:** Client Certificate and client Key are required for AWS Client application to authenticate server in secure connection. If missing of both, then it cannot be connect to server instead return an error as no certificates were found.
